## About me
Kia ora! 
I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creative problem-solving. 
My background in costume creation, specialist retail, and volunteer work for Scouting translates well to web development, fostering strong collaboration and communication skills for dynamic diverse teams. 
An interest for coding sparked in an introductory course I did at age twelve, that recently led me to the Dev Academy bootcamp. 
Now, I'm eager to leverage my adaptability and technical skills to build creative web applications.
My projects that explore React and React Native can be found on my GitHub and Portfolio. 
A continuous learner, I'm drawn to inclusive and supportive environments that embrace exploration and new challenges.
