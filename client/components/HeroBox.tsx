            I&apos;m a kiwi web developer who loves to code, design, and solve
            problems as much as I love stitching together creative projects -
            and trust me, I&apos;ve sewn up plenty!
            <br /> Before web development, I ran my own professional costuming
            business, so bringing ideas to life is kind of my thing.
            <br />
            <br /> Whether it&apos;s front-end or full-stack, I&apos;m all about
            turning ideas into pixel-perfect, user-friendly creations. I enjoy
            collaborating with awesome people, thinking outside the (code)box,
            and building tools that actually make life easier. Always learning,
            always growingâ€”and having fun while I&apos;m at it!
