                I&apos;m a kiwi web developer who loves to code, design, and
                solve problems as much as I love stitching together creative
                projects - and trust me, I&apos;ve sewn up plenty!
                <br /> Before web development, I ran my own professional
                costuming business, so bringing ideas to life is kind of my
                thing.
                <br />
                <br /> Whether it&apos;s front-end or full-stack, I&apos;m all
                about turning ideas into pixel-perfect, user-friendly creations.
                I enjoy collaborating with awesome people, thinking outside the
                (code)box, and building tools that actually make life easier.
                Always learning, always growingâ€”and having fun while I&apos;m at
                it!
